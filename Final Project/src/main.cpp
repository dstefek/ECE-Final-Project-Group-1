/*  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Completely automated system 
  2. Feeder cannot be accessed by pets. 
  3. Measured ratios are dispensed based on size/type of animal. 
  4. Ratios are correct based on the selection made from menu.

/* TODO: 

LCD Display: 
    - Figure out communication protocol. Likely SPI. To communicate with the various devises. 
    - Accept input to display text to user. 

Stepper Motor: 
    - Accept prompt to activate. 
    - Activation will have the motor turn a designated amount (amount can be specified, 
      but must be changeable for when physical model is ready.)
    - Can likely use the same system used in lab 4. 

Input sensor. (ie 4x4 keypad)
    - Accept input from the user to be used in the system. (menu driven selection)
    - Accept override input form button at any time

Timer system:
    - 
    - Keeps track of long periods (up to 24 hours?)
    - Can be interrupted and reset.
